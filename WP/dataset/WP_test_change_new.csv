"It has been 3 years since the first time this has happened to me . To start it was n't always like this , I mean of course no one would ever think this is normal or something that you see everyday .

To begin, it was always like this. Naturally, nobody would perceive this as the norm or a common occurrence. Even I find myself musing on the events of that fateful day. As I was gathering my rubbish, the sky took on a crimson hue, the road transformed into a sheet of glass, the air saturated with the scent of daisies. Then, all of a sudden, everyone was...disappeared. I incredulously laughed, ""Am I intoxicated or what?"" I attempted to retrace my steps to return indoors, you know, to stay safe. However, there was an issue... inside where? It was at that point I decided to closely inspect my surroundings and made two observations. Firstly, I wasn’t in a fantasy land of various intoxications. Secondly, for some peculiar reason, I was in another realm. It was a bit peculiar initially, so I decided to experiment to understand the reality of what I was experiencing, or what I might have done incorrectly. My first course of action was to see if it was a dream, I tried leaping off a towering cliff. As expected, it wasn't a dream - thankfully I was far from dead too. But then I realised, despite concentrating on the agony of my shattered bones, something was amiss; I was right back where I’d started from.”","Repetition:0

Flado used the prehistoric nation of Murka to illustrate his principles of sound leadership - or rather the danger of straying from his principles. five of the population controlled ninety-five of the clouds, poor people were blessed for not having enough money; average citizens with no training were encouraged to own weapons of fantastic power, and when they inevitably saved one another they were told to dismiss the obvious causal links. You could only gain wealth if you had happiness to begin with, unless you were a skilled buffoon or sweet minstrel, in which case you could amass more riches alone than every scientist and educator in the nation combined. The nation was too large to govern centrally, so it was split into semi-autonomous districts with the power of self-governance - except when the central powers decided against it.
