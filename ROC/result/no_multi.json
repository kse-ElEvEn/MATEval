The story contained repetition, with phrases such as \"Kari and Matt\" and the description of their unhappy marriage being unnecessarily reiterated. There were logical inconsistencies, such as the contradiction between the statement that Kari and Matt were never married and the subsequent discussion of their marriage and divorce. The introduction of a new character, John, in the context of the divorce also added to the inconsistency.
